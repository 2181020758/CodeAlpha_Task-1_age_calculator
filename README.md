# Age Calculator Project
HTML Form:

The form collects the day, month, and year of birth.

The form has required attributes to ensure that users enter all values.

An event listener is attached to the form to handle the submit event.

JavaScript:

The form submission is intercepted to prevent the default page reload.

The day, month, and year values are retrieved from the form inputs.

The date of birth (dob) and the current date (today) are created as JavaScript Date objects.

The age is initially calculated by subtracting the birth year from the current year.

The result is displayed in a div with the id 'result'.
